# SUPPLY CHAIN-ANALYSIS

The key insights include, 
  Column and Bar Charts 📊 ; I visualized late delivery risks by region and orders by market and risk, providing clear insights into performance and potential improvement areas.

  Line charts 📈. I use a line chart to analyze sales trends over the years to identify which year had the highest sales and which didn’t.

  Interactive reports📝; I enabled dynamic data exploration using slicers and filters, making it easy to interact and drill down to a specific metric.

  Pie chart; I used a pie chart to show order by delivery status 

These visualizations helped me answer the following questions;

* Which region has the highest late delivery risk?
* What are the trends in sales over different months and years?
* How do order volume and late delivery risks vary by market?
*  How many orders had late delivery, on-time delivery, and canceled order status?
*  How many orders were late, canceled, and on time?
