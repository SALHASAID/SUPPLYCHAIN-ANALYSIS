# Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard

## Overview
This project involves creating an interactive **Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard** using **Power BI.** The dashboard provides insights into supply chain performance, including sales trends, delivery status, and regional analysis. The goal is to identify inefficiencies, improve delivery times, and optimize profitability.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Filters:** Users can filter data by year, region, and delivery status.
- **Key Metrics:** Displays total sales, net profit ratio, cost, shipments, and average delivery time.
- **Delivery Analysis:** Tracks late deliveries, on-time shipping, and canceled orders.
- **Regional Insights:** Visualizes late delivery risk and total sales by market.
- **Time-Based Trends:** Shows monthly sales and orders over the years.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes information on:
- Sales
- Orders
- Deliveries
- Regions

## Tools and Technologies
- **SQL:** For data preparation, cleaning, and analysis.
- **Data Modeling:** Structured the data using a star schema for efficient analysis.
- **Power BI:** For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** For creating calculated metrics (e.g., Net Profit Ratio, Late Delivery Risk).

## Key Insights
1. **Late Deliveries:** 17.94% of orders in 2016 were delivered late, with the highest risk in West Asia.
2. **Sales Trends:** Sales peaked in October 2016, indicating seasonal demand.
3. **Regional Performance:** The US and Europe had the highest sales but also the highest late delivery rates.
